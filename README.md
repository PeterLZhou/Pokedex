# Pokedex

This is an android mobile app that will allow users to log locations of pokemon they catch.

Eventually we hope to develop an algorithm that will approximate locations, times, weather conditions, and geography for every pokemon caught, just like in the real game's pokedex.
We also want to add a map that shows team boundaries (Mystic, Instinct, or Valor) by getting gym locations.

TODO for Pokemon Map:
-Create custom bitmap for the pokemon trainer
-Make a loading screen
-Create a cool design for the input boxes
-Get GET and POST requests to work
-Find a way to hook weather.com for weather, get time, and use googlemaps to determine geography
