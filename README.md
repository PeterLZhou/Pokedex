# Pokedex

This is an android mobile app that will allow users to log locations of pokemon they catch.

Eventually we hope to develop an algorithm that will approximate locations, times, weather conditions, and geography for every pokemon caught, just like in the real game's pokedex.
We also want to add a map that shows team boundaries (Mystic, Instinct, or Valor) by getting gym locations.

TODO for Pokemon Map:
-Setup Firebase Cloud Messaging / Backend to receive pokemon catch calls
-Create custom bitmap for pokemon catches, maybe colorcode based on rarity/CP?
-Add dropdown or autocomplete box to input pokemon caught
-Find a way to hook weather.com for weather, get time, and use googlemaps to determine geography
